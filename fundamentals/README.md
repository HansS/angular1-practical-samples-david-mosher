# Practical Angular JS: Fundamentals

In this repository we'll work through creating a sample standalone single page app using core angular directives and services.

## Dependencies

- You need a **Browser** you are comfortable with, I use Chrome and Chrome Dev Tools for exploring pieces of the framework.
- **Static Web Server**, I use a small [bash script](https://gist.github.com/davemo/5329141#file-bash_profile-L34) that works for OSX, if you're on windows and have NodeJS installed I recommend the `serve` package; you can snag it with `npm i -g serve` and invoke it from the command line in this directory.
