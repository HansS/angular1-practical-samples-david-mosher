# Practical Angular JS: Advanced

In this folder we'll work to wrap a 3rd party library, kendo-ui, with directives and create a custom DSL for displaying a datagrid.

## Topics Covered

- custom directives
- link, compile, require
- pre and post linking
- application lifecycle (compile, link)
- `ng-init`
- debugging tools & techniques

## Dependencies

- You need a **Browser** you are comfortable with, I use Chrome and Chrome Dev Tools for exploring pieces of the framework.
- **Static Web Server**, I use a small [bash script](https://gist.github.com/davemo/5329141#file-bash_profile-L34) that works for OSX, if you're on windows and have NodeJS installed I recommend the `serve` package; you can snag it with `npm i -g serve` and invoke it from the command line in this directory.
